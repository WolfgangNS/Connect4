I'm looking to formulate an optimal strategy in a game of Connect 4. I was heavily inspired by Deepmind's AlphaZero, an AI designed for chess. However, chess has already been "solved", making it boring to me. I want to solve an unsolved problem.

The rules are simple: the first player to connect four dots wins. I first heard about this coding exercise in 2018 when my friend from the library (then working on a master's thesis in economics) said they had to program it within a week. (Wow!) Now that I have Gemini, Colab, and ChatGPT to help me, this problem has become much easier, and allowed me to focus more on strategies and less on debugging.
